"75","CMIP3, MULTI-MODEL MEAN SIMULATION Temperature Difference (F) from 1971-2000","Simulated difference in mean annual temperature (F) for the Great Plains region, for each future time period (2021-2050, 2041-2070, and 2071-2099) with respect to the reference period of 1971-2000. These fields are multi-model means from the 15 CMIP3 global climate simulations for the high (A2) and low (B1) emissions scenarios. Color with stippling (category 3) indicates that more than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change in temperature, and more than 67% agree on the sign of the change (see text). Temperature changes increase throughout the 21st century, more rapidly for the high emissions scenario.","Great Plains","Simulated","Temperature (F)","CLIMATE OF THE U.S. GREAT PLAINS","Andrew Buddenberg","CMIP3_TTest",,"figures/GreatPlains/CMIP3_Temp_GP.jpg","figures/GreatPlains/CMIP3_Temp_GP.jpg, figures/GreatPlains/GP_precip_annual.png, figures/GreatPlains/GP_precip_seasonal_a2.png","metadata/GreatPlains/Great Plains_75_metadata.html","docs/GreatPlains/Great Plains_75_docs.blah"
