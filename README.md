drupal-massupload
=================

Mass upload script(s) for drupal content.

This is a collection of scripts that I wrote in Dec 2012 / Jan 2013 to facilitate the automatica loading
of content into a specific Drupal site.  These scripts are not intended to be generally usable on other
Drupal sites, but this code could serve as a template for writing similar mass upload systems.
