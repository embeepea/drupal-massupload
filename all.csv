Results are shown for the low (B1) emissions scenario (left) and the high (A2) emissions scenario (right). A total of 74 simulations of the 20th century were used. For the 21st century, there were 40 simulations for the high emissions scenario and 32 for the low emissions scenario. For each model simulation, the annual temperature values were first transformed into anomalies by subtracting the simulations 1901-1960 average from each annual value. Then, the mean bias between model and observations was removed by adding the observed 1901-1960 average to each annual anomaly value from the simulation. For each year, all available model simulations were used to calculate the multi-model mean and the 5th and 95th percentile bounds for that year. Then, the mean and 5th and 95th percentile values were smoothed with a 10-year moving boxcar average.","SW","Observed, Simulated","Mean annual temperature difference (deg F /  year)","Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

For the 21st century, there were 40 simulations for the high emissions scenario and 32 for the low emissions scenario. For each model simulation, the annual temperature values were first transformed into anomalies by subtracting the simulations 1901-1960 average from each annual value. Then, the mean bias between model and observations was removed by adding the observed 1901-1960 average to each annual anomaly value from the simulation. For each year, all available model simulations were used to calculate the multi-model mean and the 5th and 95th percentile bounds for that year. Then, the mean and 5th and 95th percentile values were smoothed with a 10-year moving boxcar average.","MW","Observed, Simulated","Mean annual temperature difference (deg F /  year)","Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

Anomalies greater than zero indicate temperatures that are above-average, while anomalies less than zero indicate below-average temperatures. A 7-year running-mean filter has been applied to the data to create a smoothed trend curve (black curve). Linear trends have been computed for two periods, 1919-2006 and 1975-2006, where the latter period emphasizes the observed enhanced warming. Temperature anomalies are increasing at both high and low-elevation stations. The steeper warming trend in high-elevation stations (>800 meters/0.5 mile) is visible in the bottom panel, especially when compared to that of the low-elevation stations in the middle panel (<800 meters/0.5 mile). Error bars show a standard deviation range of +/-0.5. Thick lines show 7-year running means. Asterisks indicate slopes significant at p = 0.05.

The models show no pattern of agreement even on the sign of the change in strength of future ENSO oscillations, but most of the models agree in simulating a weakening of the mean gradients, which was interpreted roughly as a trend towards mean \"El Nio-like\" conditions.

The dashed line is a linear fit. Based on daily COOP data from long-term stations in the National Climatic Data Centers Global Historical Climate Network data set. Only stations with less than 10% missing daily temperature data for the period 1895-2011 are used in this analysis. Events are first identified for each individual station by ranking all 4-day period mean temperature values and choosing the highest (heat waves) and lowest (cold waves) non-overlapping N/5 events, where N is the number of years of data for that particular station. Then, event numbers for each year are averaged for all stations in each 1x1? grid box. Finally, a regional average is determined by averaging the values for the individual grid boxes. This regional average is the index. The most frequent intense heat waves occurred during the 1930s and 50s, however, there is no overall trend. There is also no significant overall trend in the number of intense cold wave events.","SE","Observed","Relative number of heat spells (/ year), Relative number of cold spells ( / year)","Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

Only stations with less than 10% missing daily temperature data are used in this analysis. Individual station events are first identified by sorting 4-day running average mean temperature values and selecting the top Y/R events, where Y is the number of years with data and R is the recurrence interval. Then, annual grid box values are calculated as the #events/#stations with data. Finally, regional values are calculated as the average values of the grid boxes within the region. The index values are normalized to a long-term average value of 1.0. Index values that are above (below) average are upward (downward). The horizontal labels indicate the decade.
