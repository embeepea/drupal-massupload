For each model simulation, the annual temperature values were first transformed into anomalies by subtracting the simulations 1901-1960 average from each annual value. Then, the mean bias between model and observations was removed by adding the observed 1901-1960 average to each annual anomaly value from the simulation. For each year, all available model simulations were used to calculate the multi-model mean and the 5th and 95th percentile bounds for that year.

For the 21st century, there were 40 simulations for the high emissions scenario and 32 for the low emissions scenario. For each model simulation, the annual temperature values were first transformed into anomalies by subtracting the simulations 1901-1960 average from each annual value. Then, the mean bias between model and observations was removed by adding the observed 1901-1960 average to each annual anomaly value from the simulation.

384,"Projected greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations","a) Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (GtCO2-equivalent per year) from 2000 to 2100 for two of the SRES scenarios: A2 (red line) and B1 (blue line). Adapted from IPCC (2007) Fig. 3.1. b) Observed annual mean (black line) and projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ppm) for two of the SRES scenarios: A2 (red line) and B1 (blue line). Observations are measurements from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, from 1958 to 2008. Projections are from two fast carbon cycle models the Bern Model and the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM). Data from IPCC (2012). These graphs show that the CO2 concentrations are comparable under these two scenarios in the early part of the 21st century but diverge greatly by the end of the century.","Pacific Islands","","Greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 concentrations","Climate of the Pacific Islands","Laura Stevens","IPCC","","","","",""
385,"Annual average surface temperature anomalies","Annual average surface temperature anomalies are increasing at both high and low-elevation stations in Hawaii (a total of 21). Temperature anomalies are calculated first as the departure from the monthly mean, and then averaged into a calendar year. Anomalies greater than zero indicate temperatures that are above-average, while anomalies less than zero indicate below-average temperatures. A 7-year running-mean filter has been applied to the data to create a smoothed trend curve (black curve). Linear trends have been computed for two periods, 1919-2006 and 1975-2006, where the latter period emphasizes the observed enhanced warming. The steeper warming trend in high-elevation stations (>800 meters/0.5 mile) is visible in the bottom panel, especially when compared to that of the low-elevation stations in the middle panel (<800 meters/0.5 mile). Error bars show a standard deviation range of +/-0.5. Thick lines show 7-year running means. Asterisks indicate slopes significant at p = 0.05.

386,"Air temperature trends","Air Temperature in Hawaii (red line) prior to 1975 is tightly coupled to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (blue line) (top panel). Since 1975, air temperature has diverged increasingly from the observed PDO, which may indicate the increasing influence of climate change in the North Central Pacific subregion. Local sea surface temperature anomalies (blue line, for 22N, 156W based on the Smith and Reynolds (2004) Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures (ERSST) data set) are also coupled to air temperatures (red line) in Hawaii (bottom panel), and show a similar decoupling around 1975 (Giambelluca et al. 2008).","Pacific Islands","","","Climate of the Pacific Islands","","ERSST","http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.html","","","",""
387,"Trade-Wind Inversion Occurence","The frequency of occurrence of the trade-wind inversion over Hawaii Island increased during the 1990s from less than 80% to occurring around 90% of the time.

388,"Time series of Hawaii Rainfall Index","The annual time series of the Hawaii Rainfall Index (HRI) from 1905 to 2010 shows a long-term downward (drying) trend over the last 105 years. Annual values (July to June) are used. For example, 2010 refers to the period from July 2010 to June 2011. Nine stations from each of three islands (Kauai, Oahu, and Hawaii) are selected. These 27 stations are representative of the spatial variability of rainfall with regard to the direction of the prevailing northeast trade winds (i.e., windward and leeward) and to varying elevation levels (i.e., high and low). A normalization method is applied to each station to obtain standardized anomalies and the HRI is then calculated as the average of all station anomalies from three islands (Chu and Chen 2005).","Pacific Islands","","","Climate of the Pacific Islands","","","","","","",""
389,"Precipitation anomaly trends","In trends similar to air temperature, precipitation anomalies have followed the same pattern of decoupling from the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) since 1975, most likely as a result of long-term average climate change. Precipitation anomalies at stations on four Hawaiian Islands in the wet season (November  April) that are smoothed decadally correspond to the decadally smoothed PDO index. Anomalies greater than zero indicate precipitation that is above-average, while anomalies less than zero indicate below-average precipitation (Frazier et al. 2011).","Pacific Islands","","","Climate of the Pacific Islands","","","","","","",""
