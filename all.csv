The snowfall percentile threshold for each station was calculated using the base period of 1937-38 to 2006-07. The percentage of stations exceeding the threshold for each region is calculated by dividing the number of stations in the region above the threshold by the number of active stations each year. The thick black line is an 11-year running mean of the percentages, and the dashed line is the number of active stations. Based on data from the National Climatic Data Center for the NWS Cooperative Observer Network. Only stations with less than 10% missing daily snowfall data for the period 1930-2004 are used in this analysis.

The dashed line is a linear fit. Based on daily COOP data from long-term stations in the National Climatic Data Centers Global Historical Climate Network data set. Only stations with less than 10% missing daily temperature data for the period 1895-2011 are used in this analysis. Events are first identified for each individual station by ranking all 4-day period mean temperature values and choosing the highest (heat waves) and lowest (cold waves) non-overlapping N/5 events, where N is the number of years of data for that particular station. Then, event numbers for each year are averaged for all stations in each 1x1 grid box. Finally, a regional average is determined by averaging the values for the individual grid boxes. This regional average is the index. The most frequent intense heat waves occurred during the 1930s and 50s, however, there is no overall trend. There is also no significant overall trend in the number of intense cold wave events.","SE","Observed","Temperature","CLIMATE OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S.","Laura Stevens","GHCN-D","ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/","figures/Southeast/heatcoldwave_4dy5yr_SE.png","","metadata/Southeast/001TSU2013SCE1.020SE.html",""
403,"Time series of freeze-free season anomalies","Freeze-free season anomalies shown as number of days per year. Length of the freeze-free season is defined as the period between the last occurrence of 32F in the spring and first occurrence of 32F in the fall. The dashed line is a linear fit. Based on daily COOP data from long-term stations in the National Climatic Data Centers Global Historical Climate Network data set. Only stations with less than 10% missing daily temperature data for the period 1895-2011 are used in this analysis. Freeze events are first identified for each individual station. Then, event dates for each year are averaged for 1x1 grid boxes. Finally, a regional average is determined by averaging the values for the individual grid boxes. There is no overall statistically significant trend.","SE","Observed","Temperature","CLIMATE OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S.","Laura Stevens","GHCN-D","ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/","figures/Southeast/freeze-free_season_anom.SE.Length_trend.png","","metadata/Southeast/001TSU2013SCE1.026SE.html",""
404,"Decadal time series of cold wave indices","Time series of decadal average values of cold wave indices for spells of 4-day duration exceeding the threshold for a 1-in-5 year recurrence, based on daily COOP data from long-term stations in the National Climatic Data Centers Global Historical Climate Network data set. Only stations with less than 10% missing daily temperature data for the period 1895-2011 are used in this analysis. Individual station events are first identified by sorting 4-day running average mean temperature values and selecting the top Y/R events, where Y is the number of years with data and R is the recurrence interval. Then, annual grid box values are calculated as the #events/#stations with data. Finally, regional values are calculated as the average values of the grid boxes within the region. The index values are normalized to a long-term average value of 1.0. Index values that are above (below) average are upward (downward). The horizontal labels indicate the decade","US","Observed","Temperature","CLIMATE OF THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES","Ken Kunkel","GHCN-D","ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/","figures/UnitedStates/Extreme_Cold_Temperature_v7.png","","metadata/UnitedStates/001TSU2013SCE1.012US.html",""
